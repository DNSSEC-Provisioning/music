Datastructures

There are four principal datastructures: Zones, Signers, SignerGroups
and FSMs. 

A "signer" refers to a DNS operator capable of DNSSEC signing. The
signer structure contains information about how to interact with this
operator (via DDNS, via API, etc) and the authentication details for such
interaction.

A "signergroup" is simply a group of signers. Signergroups don't have
to do anything by themselves, they only exist as the recipients for
the various types of synching that are needed for zones that use a
signergroup.

A "zone" is a DNS zone, it has a name and potentially it has a
signergroup that manages DNSSEC signing. During transitions of various
types it also has an FSM reference, which is the description of the
transition that the zone is currently undergoing.

An "FSM" is a finite state machine that describes a sychronization
process in a signergroup. There are several known FSMs, including:n

* "AddGroup": add a signergroup to a zone. This will cause MuSiC to
interact with all the signers in the group to get DNSKEY and NS RRsets
in sync, get CDS records published and subsequently the parent DS RRset
updated and likely also the parent NS RRset.

* "ZskRollover": one of the signers in a signergroup decided to roll
the ZSK for a zone. This causes MuSiC to pick up on the added ZSK and
initiate synching the DNSKEY for the new ZSK over to the other signers
in the signergroup.

* "KskRollover": NYI.

Command structure

* "music-cli signer"": commands to manage signers

-  "music-cli signer add -s {name}": add a new signer to the set of
                                     signers known to MuSiC 

- "music-cli signer delete -s {name}": delete a signer from MuSiC. Will
                                       also remove the signer from all
	                               signergroups that it was a member of.

- "music-cli signer list": list all signers

* "music-cli sgroup": commands to manage signergroups

- "music-cli sgroup create -g {group}": create a new signergroup called {group}

- "music-cli sgroup add -g {group} -s {signer}": add the signer {signer}
                                                 to the signergroup {group}

- "music-cli sgroup list": list all signer groups

* "music-cli zone": commands to manage zones

"music-cli zone add -z {zone}": add the zone {zone} to MuSiC

"music-cli zone list": list all zones under MuSiC management

"music-cli zone sgroup -z {zone} -g {group}": assign the signergroup {group}
                                              to manage the zone {zone}
